REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

Question 1
----------
Multithreading allows different Blocks to point to the same father, since assigning a father to a Block and actually 
attaching it to the tree are done by different threads. The parameter affecting is the amount of time since a father was assigned
and until it was actually attached, in this case it is the time the hash function takes, so a quicker hash function can change that.

Question 2
----------
We can keep track of the last block in the longest chain and assign it as a father to every new Block. When we attach a block,
if it's marked father is the longest chain block, we attach it and replace the longest chain block with it. If it's father is not
the longest chain block, delete it, because it will never be part of the longest chain.

Question 3
----------
When closing the chain we should make sure that no one is holding, nor will be holding, any non-static mutex because we're
about to destroy it.
