REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

Question 1
----------
RR pro: Any thread is promised to wait a time proportional to the number of threads in the system.
In RR+ this is no longer correct, higher priority threads can starve lower priority threads.
RR con: Can cause significant overhead for CPU intensive threads. RR+ does not solve this issue.
PQ pro: Can lead to a more interactive system by putting interactive threads in a higher priority.
RR+ improves on that by adding preemption.
PQ con: Can cause starvation of lower priority threads. RR+ does not solve this issue (except for
the case of a queue with a single thread).

Question 2
----------
An example is a case when a process is waiting for data to be read from the disk. It is then blocked
until the data was fully read and is ready.
