Question 1
----------


Question 2
----------
In the experiment we transferred files of 6 different sizes: 1kb, 100kb, 1mb, 5mb, 10mb and 20mb.
For each file we opened the socket, transferred the file and closed the socket 100 times and
took the average time. Judging by the results, the transmission time grows linearly with the file
size, which is something we would expect from a reasonable protocol.
